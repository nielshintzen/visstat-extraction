# Welcome at VISSTAT extraction webpage #
The purpose of this WIKI and code platform is to provide an up-to-date and user-friendly way to extract data from the VISSTAT database. All sorts of 'templates' will be uploaded and maintained to be used by anyone with permission to extract data from VISSTAT.

In general, extracting data from VISSTAT can be complicated and the results you obtain from querying the database can depend on your understanding of the construction of VISSTAT. It is for this reason encouraged to use the templates from this WIKI as they are tested and updated regularly.

If you need an extraction that goes beyond that what is offered in the templates, please consult Niels Hintzen or Peter van der Kamp.
