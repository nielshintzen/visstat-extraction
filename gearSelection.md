# Extract specific gear type from VMS #
VMS itself does not contain gear characteristics. Neither does it contain information on the composition of the catch made during a fishing trip. To obtain this information, VMS and Logbook data can be combined.

It is highly recommended not to combine these data sources straight from VISSTAT, as in general, the VMS and logbook data contain too many errors to create a reliable dataset. Hence, procedures have been written to clean up the VMS (tacsat) and logbook (eflalo) data and combine them within the software program R. The [VMStools library](http://code.google.com/p/vmstools) contains a list of functions to do exactly this job.
