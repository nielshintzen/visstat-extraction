# Getting started in SQL developer #

Once you have started SQL developer you need to establish a connection with visstat.

Click the green '+' sign under the connection tab on your left.
In the screen that appears, in the toppanel you need to fill out:
> Connection Name: visstatp<br>
<blockquote>Username: <your username><br>
Password: <your password><br></blockquote>

In the bottom panel, you need to fill out:<br>
<blockquote>Hostname: raja.wurnet.nl<br>
Port: 1521<br>
SID: visstatp<br></blockquote>

And hereafter, click to 'Connect' button.<br>
Once you open the visstatp connection (expand list) go to 'Other Users' folder and click the 'VISSTAT_OWNER'. Now you can directly look into the format of the tables and the tables itself.<br>

To extract data using SQL developer, simply copy the SQL code from this WIKI into a new SQL developer sheet (File -> new) and run the statements (Green triangle).
